# Partition OpenMoji Emojis

I partitioned the emojis in this set into 4 categories:

1. Flags - Emojis of flags. There are many flags and I'm not sure whether they'll be worth annotating.
3. Small - Graphics with fewer than 5 paths. 
2. Duplicates - Copies of graphics in different skin tones.
4. Interesting - Distinct and worthwhile graphics that we can get annotated. 

There are about 1606 graphics in the Interesting category.
